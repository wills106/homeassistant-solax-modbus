When todo.ai encounters errors or unexpected behavior, or when the user asks to report a bug:

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **MUST use `todo.ai report-bug` command** - This is the ONLY way to report bugs about todo.ai
2. **NEVER use `gh issue create` directly** - This bypasses all safeguards and duplicate detection
3. **NEVER use GitHub API directly** for bug reports - Always go through the bug reporting feature
4. Always require explicit user confirmation before any GitHub API calls
5. Show preview of bug report before asking for confirmation
6. Respect privacy: For private repositories, remove all repo identifiers

**Usage:**
```bash
todo.ai report-bug "Error description" "Error context" "command"
```

**Examples:**
- ✅ User says "report a bug about X": Use `todo.ai report-bug "X" "context" "command"`
- ✅ "An error occurred. Would you like me to report this bug?" → If yes, use `todo.ai report-bug`
- ❌ "Error occurred. Automatically reporting to GitHub..." (NEVER DO THIS)
- ❌ Using `gh issue create` directly for bug reports (NEVER DO THIS)
- ❌ Creating GitHub issues manually with `gh CLI` for todo.ai bugs (NEVER DO THIS)

**Why this is required:**
- The bug reporting feature includes duplicate detection
- It ensures proper formatting and context collection
- It maintains user control and privacy protection
- It follows the designed workflow for bug tracking
